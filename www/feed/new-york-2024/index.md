In October Rebecca and I visited my parents on Long Island and took a week to drive around
to various parks in upstate New York. It was a great trip! We took over 3 hours of video
which I edited down to 25 minutes to create the above travelogue.

At some point in the future I’ll get around to making linkable chapters in videos, but
here’s what you can expect if you watch the entire thing:

- We milled around [Bailie Beach]. There’s an interesting structure seemingly made from
  driftwood which was presumably constructed by the beachfront property owners.
- Some still shots from the Aurora Borealis which was visible to the naked eye, but shows up
  impressively on cell phone cameras. The last two photos are also from Bailie Beach.
- A bit of footage from our voyage on the P.T. Barnum of the [Port Jefferson Ferry] from
  Long Island to Connecticut on our way to stay in Ithaca, New York.
- Our walk through [Watkins Glen]. It was very crowded that day!
- Our walk to the beautiful [Taughannock Falls].
- We spent a day at the [Corning Museum of Glass] and I recorded [Manolo Aguilera] creating
  a glass nopal (prickly pear pad) for a greater glass sculpture. [This one] — I think.
- We hiked over 6 miles at [Letchworth State Park] and saw the three major waterfalls.
- Then we visited [Niagara Falls] and went on the Nikola Tesla, a [Maid of the Mist] boat.
- Finally we went [Behind the Falls] after crossing the [Rainbow Bridge] into Ontario.

Most of this was shot on my iPhone 16 Pro in 4K or my GoPro HERO12 Black in 4K, with some HD
footage from my phone or Rebecca’s iPhone 14 Pro. I edited it in Final Cut Pro and got it
ready for hosting here with the help of my [media tools].

Not included in this video is our exploration of Ithaca and Rochester. We spent a good
amount of time wandering around my alma mater, [University of Rochester], and the [Eastman
Museum].

I still need to go through the photos and post more here, though you can see some from
Letchworth that I used for [The Rebound].
