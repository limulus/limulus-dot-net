Simon P. Couch used energy-per-token estimates [to calculate his AI coding energy
use][link]:

> On a median day, I estimate I consume 1,300 Wh through Claude Code — 4,400 “typical
> queries” worth. (For those wondering, this is $15-20 of token spend on a typical day.)

This number matches my mental model for my own AI energy use. When Claude Code is churning
away, I picture an ultra-high-end GPU at full utilization dedicated to my request for a
minute or two.

Recently I built a gaming PC and hooked it up to my UPS with a wattage output display. When
playing graphics-intensive games, I see that I’m consuming about 500 W more than I would be
if I was just using my Mac Studio.

My median day of AI coding undoubtedly uses less than $15–$20 of token spend. But even if it
did use that much, it would still be less energy use than 3 hours of flight simming.[^1]

Granted, both of these newish behaviors (AI coding and PC gaming) are net increases in my
energy use. But I’m finding it hard to feel bad about either of them, especially when no one
is telling heavy gamers they should feel ashamed of their energy usage.

    1,300 Wh estimate.
