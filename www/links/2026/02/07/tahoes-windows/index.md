In general I think the larger corner radiuses of windows in macOS Tahoe look fine. But if
Apple really wanted to make this new look functional they really needed to rethink how
windows work at a more fundamental level. The window’s corners should not be clipping the
scroll bar. The resize target needs to be increased. Toolbar items should feel like they
naturally fit in a window’s corner.

What Apple shipped is how I expect an overly-ambitious Linux theme to work within the
constraints of X11 — not macOS.
